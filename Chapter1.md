<ul> 
<li> Networking Model (Standardized Model) 

<li> Initially the TCP/IP model was created before the OSI Model by the DoD in late 1970s and then further developed by universities and alike. 

<li> OSI was created by the ISO but became soon irrelevant because of the leading TCP/IP Model. Now it's mostly used for education. 

<li> During the 1990s there was a mixed of OSI and TCP/IP

<li>Defined in Documents called RFCs. 

<li>Also refers to standards/protocols etc. For example the protocols created by the IEEE 

<li>Protocols are rules/standards that allow 2 devices to communicate. 

<li>Model is implemented in many things (Software, OS, Hardware â€¦) 

<li>5 Layers and according protocol 

<li>Application (eg. HTTP, POP3, SMTP) 

<li>Transport (eg. <mark>TCP</mark>, UDP) 

<li>Network (eg. <mark>IP</mark>, ICMP) 

<li>Data Link (eg. Ethernet, 802.11, PPP) 

Physical 

Each of the Layers has it's own standards and protocols 

The original version is a bit different and features only four layers
